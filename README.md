MOTIVATION :
The first and foremost motivation for us to choose this problem was that we knew  the basic concepts of graph algorithms.
An algorithm is basically easy to undertsand because it has a definite procedure  and is based on logic .
Most of the functions and applications which make Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in Javascript.
Therefore to learn Javascipt framework properly was even our motivation to choose this problem statement.


TECHNICAL SKILLS:
File manipulation in Javascript
Creation of 2-D matrix in Javascipt
To manage the source code in Git which is a revision control system


NON-TECHNICAL SKILLS:
Team work, problem solving, decision making


THOUGHT PROCESS:
1.The first task for us was to take input from a file as an adjacency matrix.
2.Then how to upload the file and bring it in HTML web page .
3.With DOM manipulation file how to read the contents of the adjacency matrix.
4.The next problem we faced was of creating a 2-D array because javascript does'nt allow us to define two dimensional array.
  Therefore we had to use the concept of array inside an array.
5.Our 2-D array was in string format on which we cannot perform integer operations.
  For that we used parseInt() function which converts string to integer.
  Then we had to properly understand the syntax of how to create the functions and pass parameters to it.
  
  
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1.Javascript framework 
2.Visual studio code as an editor
3.Chrome web browser
4.GIT
